* How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The easiest way to ensure my code and so on is to test it. The types of testing where we’re testing the function, such as unit tests, are important in ensuring that my code remains functional and so does the program and software. There is nothing users hate more than non-functional programs. This is true of securing my code as well. Testing the security of my code and checking for libraries and the like that have known security issues is important. These are the ways I can ensure my code’s functionality and security.

* How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

The way I interpret the user needs, minus the focus groups used by higher ups in the AGILE process, is to break everything down into smaller components. Knowing how these can be broken down is the best way to understand them. An example can be as simple as users want to the arrow keys to move their player in a game. The idea is that we take that and break it into its own unit. That way when it’s tested by a developer or a tester, we know that the player needs to move with the arrow keys and can test that it does that. Breaking these things down into manageable pieces allows for a better interpretation. Also, I will add, asking questions to clarify anything that is unknown. That is always important.

* How do I approach designing software?

The way I approach software designing is the same way I approach writing. I ask the questions of what is the project. From there I break it down to who is the target audience, what are their requirements for this software, what questions can I ask to better break down and clarify points, how can I take these requirements and break them down into smaller pieces, and finally what tests can be done based on the information I have. This is how I do things in tech writing, I ask different questions in fiction writing, but the idea is that I approach the software design by making sure I understand the goal, can show at least one panel of what I’m doing, sort of like designing one level in a game to start with, and then what do I need to do to accomplish that. By doing that, I can more easily approach the situation and potentially put out the best product possible.
